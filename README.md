# Venture funding analysis using deep learning

---

This application creates a neural network model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by the venture capital firm Alphabet Soup.

The data for this application is a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. The application creates a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. Specifically the application:

* Preprocesses data for a neural network model.
* Uses the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
* Optimizes the model by creating two alternative analyses using different inputs and evaluates the results.
